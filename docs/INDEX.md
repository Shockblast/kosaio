## Contributing Documentation

When adding new tools or features to KOSAIO, consider adding technical documentation here if:
- The tool has complex architecture
- There are important design decisions to document
- Users might need troubleshooting guidance
- The implementation has non-obvious details

Keep user-facing documentation in the main [README.md](../readme.md).
