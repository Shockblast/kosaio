# DC-VIRTCD is a CD virtualization system for the Dreamcast. It allows you to run software which accesses files on CD-ROM,
# without actually burning those files on a CD-ROM. Instead, the files are accessed over the network.
# This happens transparantly, without any modifications having to be made to the software itself.
